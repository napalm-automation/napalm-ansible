More Detailed Examples
=======

 It's very oftern we come to these tools needing to know how to run before we can walk.
Please review the [Ansible Documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html) as this will answer some basic questions.
It is also advised to have some kind of [yaml linter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yamllint) or syntax checker available. 

Non parameterized example with comments to get you started
```
- name: Test Inventory #The Task Name
  hosts: cisco         #This will be in your ansible inventory file
  connection: local    #Required
  gather_facts: no     #Do not gather facts

  tasks:                                     #Begin Tasks
    - name: get facts from device            #Task Name
      napalm_get_facts:                      #Call the napalm module, in this case napal_get_facts
        optional_args: {'secret': password}  #The enable password for Cisco IOS
        hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}" #This is a parameter and is derived from your ansible inventory file
        username: 'user'                     #The username to ssh with
        dev_os: 'ios'                        #The hardware operating system
        password: 'password'                 #The line level password
        filter: 'facts'                      #The list of items you want to retrieve. The filter keyword is _inclusive_ of what you want
      register: result                       #Ansible function for collecting output

    - name: print results                    #Task Name
      debug: msg="{{ result }}"              #Display the collected output
```

Keeping with our example dir at the beginning of the Readme, we now have this layout
```
user@host ~/workspace/ansible-playbooks
08:16 $ ls -la
total 32
drwxrwxr-x 3 user user 4096 Feb 26 07:24 .
drwxrwxr-x 8 user user 4096 Feb 25 16:32 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  404 Feb 26 07:24 inventory.yaml
```

You would run this playbook like as
```
cd ~/workspace
```
```
ansible-playbook ansible-playbooks/inventory.yaml
```

And it should produce output similar to this.

```
